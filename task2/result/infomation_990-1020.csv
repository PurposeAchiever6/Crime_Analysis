Phua et al - Criminal case; Paul Phua Trial Delayed Pending Ruling on FBI Tactics - Criminal case; Malaysia's Justice Minister Defends a Gangster - Macau trial.,"
2008 Royal Malaysia Police report on Phua was erroneous.

The defense attorneys wanted the evidence against the Phuas thrown out. The trial flagged off on Tuesday but none of the 15 defendants to the case, including Phua, turned up at the hearing. Lack of evidence hampers the trial.",English, ---, iGaming Post, iGaming Post, ---, ---
