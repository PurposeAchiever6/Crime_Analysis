Paul Phua Case Judge Discards FBI Evidence: Illegal surveillance methods used by investigators.", The 2008 Royal Malaysia Police report on Phua identified him as a member of the local 14K.," The defense argued that Phua had been in the rooms at the Wynn Macau by chance, arriving for a meeting on a potential business project just minutes before the police raid. On delivering his verdict, the judge said the Public Prosecution Office had failed to prove that the computers and papers seized from the rooms — which contained information on bets on soccer matches — belonged to the defendants. Moreover, police were unable to provide any evidence linking Phua’s phone or computer records to illegal betting activity. The prosecution has 20 days to appeal the verdict.",English, ---, iGaming Post, Online gaming authority, ---, ---
